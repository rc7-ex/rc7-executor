## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Support

If you encounter issues, please check our Wiki or the Issues tab in this **rc7 executor github** repository. Below are common solutions to frequent problems.

**Address Dump Failures:**
If the executor fails to attach, it usually means Roblox has updated. Please wait for the developers to push a new build. Do not attempt to **download rc7 executor roblox** files from third-party YouTube videos, as they are often outdated.

**Key System:**
To keep the project alive, we utilize a key system. You can generate a key at the **rc7 executor official site** which is linked inside the software's startup window. The key is valid for 24 hours.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is this detected by the anti-cheat?**
A: Currently, the status is UNDETECTED. However, exploiting always carries a risk. We recommend using an alternative account for high-risk activities.

**Q: Why does my antivirus flag the download?**
A: This is a "False Positive." Because the software injects code into another running process (Roblox), security software interprets this behavior as malicious, similar to how a virus might act, even though it is safe for the user.

**Q: Can I run this on a Mac?**
A: Native macOS support is currently in development. Mac users are advised to use Boot Camp to run Windows for the best experience.

**Q: How do I execute a script?**
A: Copy your Lua script, paste it into the main editor window, and click the "Execute" button (the play icon). You can also look for an **rc7 executor download android** tutorial on our wiki for mobile-specific UI navigation.

**Q: What happens if the app crashes upon injection?**
A: Ensure you have the Visual C++ Redistributables (x64 and x86) installed. If on mobile, ensure your device has at least 4GB of RAM.
